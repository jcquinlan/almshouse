### almshouse
## Do your chores

Simple app to make sure my roomates and I do the chores. SMS notification for overdue chores, or to annoy
the people you live with. Simple record keeping to make sure it's a fair deal.

## Setup

# Mongo
Install mongo locally. The default name for the local DB is `almshouse-dev`. For production or
test environments you'll need to set the ENV variable manually. The default *port* for Mongo is `27017`, but that most likely
won't need to be changed anywhere.
